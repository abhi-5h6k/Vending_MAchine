# Vending_Machine

Key Characteristics:
1. Single Product Offering: The vending machine dispenses a single type of product, simplifying the design and user interaction.

2. Currency Denominations: The machine accepts only two types of coins - 5 rupees and 10 rupees. This requires the machine to handle transactions where the user must insert an appropriate combination of these coins to make the purchase.

3. Cost Management: The product is priced at 15 rupees. The machine has logic to determine when sufficient funds have been inserted and to dispense the product accordingly.

4. State Machine Design: The project employs a finite state machine (FSM) to manage different states of the vending machine, such as waiting for coins, validating the inserted amount, dispensing the product, and returning change if necessary.

5. Reset Functionality: The design includes a reset function to initialize the machine to its default state, ensuring reliable operation upon power-up or reset events.

This project highlights my skills in digital design, Verilog coding, and FSM implementation.
